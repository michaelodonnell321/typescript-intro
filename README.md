# typescript-intro

Let's learn some typescript!

Learning along with Udemy to start before I apply this learing to a new project.

## Types
Existing types are going to be javascript types
number - all numbers, no integers, floats, doubles, etc
string - text 'hello world', "hello world", `` as well
boolean - true, false
Array - [1,2,3], can be flexible or strict

## Assignment note
Typescript can infer assignment, so let thing = 5; would infer a number at initialization.
If you are not assigning when a variable is created, let thing;, then it's good practice to set the type, let thing: number;
